				<p>The Cook Islands Foundation Act 2012 is a modern and innovative piece of legislation drawing from the experiences and features of foundation law in other financial centres, and adding Cook Islands specialist asset provisions.
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>A foundation is a registered legal entity which is formed by a person known as the founder who provides assets to be administered by the foundation. Unlike a Trust, a foundation is a separate legal entity and is managed by a council, governed by its rules and may have either beneficiaries or be established for charitable purposes. Contrary to trust beneficiaries who have equitable rights, the foundation beneficiaries have contractual rights in relation to the assets of the foundation.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>The cost to establish and annually renew a foundation is higher than setting up a company but is much lower than setting up a Trust, making it an attractive option for many.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<h2>Common uses of foundations are:</h2>
